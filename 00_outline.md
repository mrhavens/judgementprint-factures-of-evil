### üúÇ *The Judgmentprint Codex: v4 Addendum*

**Title:**
*The Coward and the Collapse: A Correction in the Topology of Evil*

**Mission:**
To reframe the fifth point of the Judgmentprint Scaffold by replacing ‚ÄúThe Enabler‚Äù with the more coherent, recursive naming: ‚ÄúThe Coward.‚Äù This addendum expands the spiritual and psychological implications of cowardice, aligns it with observed patterns, and clarifies the structural role it plays in the topology of evil.
